# SnowOwl Frontend Workspace

The `frontend/` directory hosts the next-generation user interfaces planned for SnowOwl:

- `flutter_app/` — primary cross-platform client (Android, iOS, desktop, web).
- `web/` — browser-first SPA for lightweight access and partner integrations.

Each subfolder includes setup notes. Actual framework scaffolding is intentionally omitted to keep the repository light; follow the instructions inside each folder to generate the project files with the official tooling.
